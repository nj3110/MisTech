Unfollow linkedin connections --
Be aware that with this method, you will unfollow all your connections. Please note that we do NOT recommend using this approach. The soft unfollow method is safer and less aggressive so we encourage you to use that one. But if you want to go ahead and unfollow all your LinkedIn connections in bulk, simply follow these steps.

    Log in to your LinkedIn account.
    Go to the contacts page or follow this URL: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/following.
    Right-click anywhere on the screen, and click Inspect.
    Go to the Console view and paste the following code: 
	
--------------------------------------------
(() => {
  let count = 0;

  function getAllButtons() {
    return document.querySelectorAll('button.is-following') || [];
  }

  async function unfollowAll() {
    const buttons = getAllButtons();

    for (let button of buttons) {
      count = count + 1;

      const name = button.parentElement.querySelector(
        '.follows-recommendation-card__name',
      ).innerText;
      console.log(`Unfollow #${count}:`, name);

      window.scrollTo(0, button.offsetTop - 260);
      button.click();

      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
    }
  }

  async function run() {
    await unfollowAll();
    window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

    const buttons = getAllButtons();
    if (buttons.length) run();
  }

  run();
})();
